0.11 - Sat Jan 31 11:24:53 CST 2004
	* No code changes.
	* Removed requirements on Test::Manifest and Test::Pod
	* Fixed warnings that show up under -w

1.31_01 - Sun May  3 06:40:14 2009
	* Added initial support for reading binary property lists

1.31 - Wed Jan 16 05:28:00 2008
	* Clean up for move from CVS to SVN. No need to upgrade.

1.30 - Tue Jan  9 22:32:27 2007
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.29 - Wed May 17 19:25:09 2006
	* Added a parse_plist_fh function so you can open the files 
	any way that you like (for instance, as ":utf8").
	* Added pod_coverage.t to MANIFEST. I use it so I might as
	well distribute it.

1.28 - Tue May 16 01:15:52 2006
	* This change actually makes the change I claimed in the last version.
	* I added parse_plist_file to @EXPORT_OK, where it should have been.

1.26 - Tue May 16 01:02:29 2006
	* Added parse_plist_file to the export list. Why was it missing?
	* There are no other code changes, and you should upgrade
	if your users expect the documentation to be right. :)

1.24 - Tue Jan 17 21:19:40 2006
	* Ricardo Signes added as_basic_data() methods to turn the plist
	stuff into a Perl data structure without all the plist
	tracking. That's probably what most people want if they
	simply want to get data.

1.23 - Sun Jun  5 19:34:38 2005
* Mike Ciul added some code to handle input differently for different
sources (file, string, etc). It's a lot faster for very large files.
* Most everything else is the same, so unless you need to work with
very large files, you don't need to rush to upgrade.

1.21 - Fri Mar 11 22:49:28 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests
	* Bumped version past the 1.0 barrier
	* No code changes: no need to upgrade

0.95 - Fri Mar 11 22:45:21 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests, fixed issues
	* no code changes: no need to upgrade

0.95 - Thu Dec  2 03:23:26 2004
	* added Exporter support so you can import the functions, just
	like the examples showed.  Nothing is imported without you asking
	for it.

0.9 - Thu Sep  2 20:15:28 2004
	* fixed from with Time::HiRes tests
	* cleaned up distribution
	* No need to upgrade if you have the previous version (0.11)

0.51 - Tue Feb  3 16:39:39 2004
    * Refactored the module to get rid of goofy data structure---if you
    peeked behind-the-scenes this will bite you
    * Each type in the plist now has its own class, with methods to affect it

0.10 - Mon Feb  3 19:53:24 2003
	* No code changes
	* added missing modules to PREREQ_PM
	* tweaked false_key test

0.09 - Fri Jan 31 11:20:53 2003
